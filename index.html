        <hr />
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            I am a Master's graduate in Industrial Engineering from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, with a passion for CAD, CAE, Reverse Engineering, Metrology, and 3D Modeling. With these skills, I have participated in multiple projects across various industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I work as an Application Engineer at Shining3D, where I provide technical support and expertise to distributors and end users all over the EMEA Region. I also mentor in 3D scan data-based Reverse Engineering and Metrology projects, and collaborate with the R&D team to drive enhancements across our product line.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always eager to learn new technologies and methods, and to connect and explore new opportunities with fellow professionals. Let's get in touch and see how we can work together.

                    Issued by HeroX · March 2021<br />
                    A critical component of Artemis program's success is the delivery of supplies and systems to the lunar surface and eventually Mars. The program needs a robust and reliable cargo-handling system that can effectively operate in the lunar environment and is compatible with a broad array of lunar lander configurations. NASA created a crowdsourcing challenge to welcome ideas that address how to unload payloads from the lunar landers.

                    Issued by GrabCAD · Nov 2020<br />
                    This contest was in support of a NASA concept study called the Advanced Lightweight Lunar Gantry for Operations (ALLGO). The goal of the ALLGO study was to develop an innovative, low-mass unloading system based on inflatable structural components that can be tightly packaged and easily deployed on the lunar surface. This system could be scaled up to operate with very large landers that have a high payload deck. An ALLGO mobile lunar gantry system could also be used for other routine operations at the Artemis base camp such as integrating large components or transporting ISRU materials for processing.
